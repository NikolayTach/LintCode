http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/subsets-ii/

Given a list of numbers that may has duplicate numbers, return all possible subsets

**Notice**

* Each element in a subset must be in non-descending order.
* The ordering between two subsets is free.
* The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Example**  
If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:
```
[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```
