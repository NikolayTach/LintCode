http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/

Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

**Notice**  
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

**Example**  
Given inorder [1,2,3] and postorder [1,3,2], return a tree:
```
  2
 / \
1   3
```
