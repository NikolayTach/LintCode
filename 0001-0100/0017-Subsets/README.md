http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/subsets/

Given a set of distinct integers, return all possible subsets.

**Notice**

Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

**Example**  
If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:
```
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```
