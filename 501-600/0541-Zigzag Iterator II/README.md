# 541. Zigzag Iterator II

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/zigzag-iterator-ii/

Follow up Zigzag Iterator: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases? The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic".

**Example**  
Given two 1d vectors:
```
v1 = [1, 2]
v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
```
By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6].
