# 540. Zigzag Iterator

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/zigzag-iterator/

Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

**Example**  
Given two 1d vectors:
```
v1 = [1, 2]
v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
```
By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6].
