Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

**Notice**  
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example**  
Given [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] return 0
