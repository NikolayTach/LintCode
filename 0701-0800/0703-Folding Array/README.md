# 703. Folding Array

Difficulty: Hard

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/folding-array/

Given an array nums of length n and an array req of length k , you need to fold the array as required, and output the result of the fold.
1.If req[i] = 0 means you should fold from left to right
for example:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  ==>   4 3 2 1
                       5 6 7 8
```
2.If req[i] = 1 means you should fold from right to left
for example:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  ==>   8 7 6 5
                       1 2 3 4
```
More example:
```
fold from left to right
4 3 2 1  ==>  6 5
5 6 7 8       3 4
              2 1
              7 8


fold from right to left
6 5  ==>   8
3 4        1
2 1        4
7 8        5
           6
           3
           2
           7 
```
**Notice**  
* n is power of two.
* k is index.(e.g. n = 2^3 = 8ï¼Œk = 3)

**Example**  
Given array nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and array req = [0, 0, 1]  
change array in place to be [8, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 7]
