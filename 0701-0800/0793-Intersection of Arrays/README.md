http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/intersection-of-arrays/

Give a number of arrays, find their intersection, and output their intersection size.

**Notice**  
* The total number of all array elements is not more than 500000.
* There are no duplicated elements in each array.

**Example**  
Given [[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[3,9,10]], return 1
```
explanation:
Only element 3 appears in all arrays, the intersection is [3], and the size is 1.
```
Given [[1,2,3,4],[1,2,5,6,7][9,10,1,5,2,3]], return 2
```
explanation:
Only element 1,2 appear in all arrays, the intersection is [1,2], the size is 2.
```
