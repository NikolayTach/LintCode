Given a string of numbers, write a function to find the maximum value from the string, you can add a + or * sign between any two numbersï¼ŒIt's different with Calculate Maximum Value, You can insert parentheses anywhere.

**Example**  
```
Given str = 01231, return 12
(0 + 1 + 2) * (3 + 1) = 12 we get the maximum value 12

Given str = 891, return 80
As 8 * (9 + 1) = 80, so 80 is maximum.
