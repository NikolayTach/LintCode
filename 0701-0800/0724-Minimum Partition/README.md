# 724. Minimum Partition

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/minimum-partition/

Given a set of integers, write a function to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

**Example**  
```
Given nums = [1, 6, 11, 5], return 1

// Subset1 = [1, 5, 6], sum of Subset1 = 12 
// Subset2 = [11], sum of Subset2 = 11   
// abs(11 - 12) = 1     
```
