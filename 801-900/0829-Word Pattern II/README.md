# 829. Word Pattern II

Difficulty: Hard

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/word-pattern-ii/

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

**Notice**  
You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.

**Example**  
Given pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue", return true.  
Given pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd", return true.  
Given pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc", return false.
