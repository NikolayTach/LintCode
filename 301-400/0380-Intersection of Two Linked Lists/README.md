# 380. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Difficulty: Medium

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

**Notice**  

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Example**  
The following two linked lists:
```
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```
begin to intersect at node c1.
