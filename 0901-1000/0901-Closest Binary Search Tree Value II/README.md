# 901. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II

Difficulty: Hard

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/closest-binary-search-tree-value-ii/

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

**Notice**  
* Given target value is a floating point.
* You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
* You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

**Example**  
Given root = {1}, target = 0.000000, k = 1, return [1].
