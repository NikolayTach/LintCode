https://lintcode.com/en/problem/count-univalue-subtrees/

Given a binary tree, count the number of uni-value subtrees.

A Uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

**Example**  
Given root = {5,1,5,5,5,#,5}, return 4.
```
              5
             / \
            1   5
           / \   \
          5   5   5
```
