http://lintcode.com/en/problem/continuous-subarray-sum-ii/

Given an circular integer array (the next element of the last element is the first element), find a continuous subarray in it, where the sum of numbers is the biggest. Your code should return the index of the first number and the index of the last number.

If duplicate answers exist, return any of them.

**Example**  
Give [3, 1, -100, -3, 4], return [4,1].
