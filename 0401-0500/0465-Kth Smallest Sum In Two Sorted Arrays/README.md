Difficulty: Hard

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/kth-smallest-sum-in-two-sorted-arrays/

Given two integer arrays sorted in ascending order and an integer k. Define sum = a + b, where a is an element from the first array and b is an element from the second one. Find the kth smallest sum out of all possible sums.

**Example**  
Given [1, 7, 11] and [2, 4, 6].

For k = 3, return 7.

For k = 4, return 9.

For k = 8, return 15.
