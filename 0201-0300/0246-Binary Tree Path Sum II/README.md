Your are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm to get all paths which sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go in a straight line down.identical.

**Example**  
Given a binary tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   /
4   2
```
for target = 6, return
```
[
  [2, 4],
  [1, 3, 2]
]
```
