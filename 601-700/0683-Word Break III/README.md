Give a dictionary of words and a sentence with all whitespace removed, return the number of sentences you can form by inserting whitespaces to the sentence so that each word can be found in the dictionary.

**Example**  
```
Given a String CatMat
Given a dictionary ["Cat", "Mat", "Ca", "tM", "at", "C", "Dog", "og", "Do"]
return 3

we can form 3 sentences, as follows:
CatMat = Cat Mat
CatMat = Ca tM at
CatMat = C at Mat
```
