Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/3sum-smaller/

Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

**Example**  
Given nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2, return 2.
```
Explanation:
Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
[-2, 0, 1]
[-2, 0, 3]
```
