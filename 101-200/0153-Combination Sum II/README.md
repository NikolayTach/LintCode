# 153. Combination Sum II

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/combination-sum-ii/

Given a collection of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

Each number in C may only be used once in the combination.

**Notice**  
* All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
* Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
* The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example**  
For example,  
If n = 4 and k = 2, a solution is:  
[[2,4],[3,4],[2,3],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
