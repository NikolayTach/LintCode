Given an integer arrays, find a contiguous subarray which has the largest sum and length should be between k1 and k2 (include k1 and k2).
Return the largest sum, return 0 if there are fewer than k1 elements in the array.

**Notice**  

Ensure that the result is an integer type.

**Example**  
Given the array [-2,2,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,3] and k1 = 2, k2 = 4, the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
