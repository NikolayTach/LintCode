# 659. Encode and Decode Strings

Difficulty: Medium

https://lintcode.com/en/problem/encode-and-decode-strings/

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

**Example**  
```
Given strs = ["lint","code","love","you"]
string encoded_string = encode(strs)

return ["lint","code","love","you"] when you call decode(encoded_string)
```
