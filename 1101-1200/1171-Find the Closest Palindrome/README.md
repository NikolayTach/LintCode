**Description**  
Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome.

The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.

1. The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
2. If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.

**Example**  
```
Input: "123"
Output: "121"
```
