An amicable pair (m,n) consists of two integers m,n for which the sum of proper divisors (the divisors excluding the number itself) of one number equals the other.

Given an integer k, find all amicable pairs between 1 and k.

**Notice**  
For each pair, the first number should be smaller than the second one.

**Example**  
Given 300, return [[220, 284]].
