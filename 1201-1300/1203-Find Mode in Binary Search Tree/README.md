Difficulty: Medium

**Description**  
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

**Example**  
```
Given BST [1,#,2,2],
return [2].
```
