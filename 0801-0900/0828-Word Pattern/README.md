# 828. Word Pattern

Difficulty: Easy

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/word-pattern/

Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

**Notice**  
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

**Example**  
Given pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog", return true.  
Given pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish", return false.  
Given pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog", return false.  
Given pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog", return false.
