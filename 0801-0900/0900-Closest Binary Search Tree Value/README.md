Difficulty: Easy

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/closest-binary-search-tree-value/

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

**Notice**  
* Given target value is a floating point.
* You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.

**Example**  
Given root = {1}, target = 4.428571, return 1.
