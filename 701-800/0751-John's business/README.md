There are n cities on an axis, numbers from 0 ~ n - 1. John intends to do business in these n cities, He is interested in Armani's shipment. Each city has a price for these goods prices [i]. For city x, John can buy the goods from the city numbered from x - k to x + k, and sell them to city x. We want to know how much John can earn at most in each city?

**Notice**  
prices.length range is [2, 100000], k <= 100000.

**Example**  
Given prices = [1, 3, 2, 1, 5], k = 2, return [0, 2, 1, 0, 4].
```
Explanationï¼š
i = 0, John can go to the city 0 ~ 2. He can not make money because the prices in city 1 and city 2 are both higher than the price in city 0, that is, ans[0] = 0;
i = 1, John can go to the city 0~3. He can buy from city 0 or city 3 to earn the largest price difference. That is, ans[1] = 2.
i = 2, John can go to the city 0~4. Obviously, he can earn the largest price difference by buying from city 3. That is, ans[2] = 1.
i = 3, John can go to the city 1~4. He can not make money cause city 3 has the lowest price. That is, ans[3] = 0.
i = 4, John can go to the city 2~4. He can earn the largest price difference by buying from city 3. That is, ans[4] = 4.
```
Given prices = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 1, return [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Explanation:
All cities are the same price, so John can not make money, that is, all ans are 0.
