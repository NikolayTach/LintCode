# 721. Next Sparse Number

Difficulty: Hard

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/next-sparse-number/

A number is Sparse if there are no two adjacent 1s in its binary representation. Given a number n, find the smallest Sparse number which greater than or equal to n.
eg. 5 (binary representation: 101) is sparse, but 6 (binary representation: 110) is not sparse.

**Example**  
Given n = 6, return 8  
Next Sparse Number is 8

Given n = 4, return 4  
Next Sparse Number is 4

Given n = 38, return 40  
Next Sparse Number is 40

Given n = 44, return 64  
Next Sparse Number is 64
