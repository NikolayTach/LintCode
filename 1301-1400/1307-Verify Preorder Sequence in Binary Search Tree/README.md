**Description**  
Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Follow up:
Could you do it using only constant space complexity?

**Example**  
Example 1:
```
Input: preorder = [1,3,2]
Output: true
```
