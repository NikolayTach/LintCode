Difficulty: Medium

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/odd-even-linked-list/description

**Description**  
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

**Example**  
```
Example:
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL,
return 1->3->5->2->4->NULL.
```
