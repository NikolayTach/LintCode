# 426. Restore IP Addresses

Difficulty: Medium

http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/restore-ip-addresses/

Given a string containing only digits, restore it by returning all possible valid IP address combinations.

**Example**  
Given "25525511135", return
```
[
  "255.255.11.135",
  "255.255.111.35"
]
```
Order does not matter.
