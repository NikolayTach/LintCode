# 459. Closest Number in Sorted Array

Difficulty: Easy

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/closest-number-in-sorted-array/

Given a target number and an integer array A sorted in ascending order, find the index i in A such that A[i] is closest to the given target.

Return -1 if there is no element in the array.

**Notice**  

There can be duplicate elements in the array, and we can return any of the indices with same value.

**Example**  
Given [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 5].

For target = 2, return 2.

For target = 5, return 5.

For target = 6, return -1.
