Difficulty: Easy

http://lintcode.com/en/problem/valid-palindrome/

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

**Notice**  

Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

**Example**  
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.

"race a car" is not a palindrome.
