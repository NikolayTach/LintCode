http://lintcode.com/en/problem/identical-binary-tree/

Check if two binary trees are identical. Identical means the two binary trees have the same structure and every identical position has the same value.

**Example**  
``` 
  1             1
   / \           / \
  2   2   and   2   2
 /             /
4             4
```
are identical.
```
    1             1
   / \           / \
  2   3   and   2   3
 /               \
4                 4
```
